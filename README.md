# Some weird stuff
Some "power of 2" with complex number stuff from this Video -> (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFftmWSzgmk)  
Very interesting yes change `int n = 256` at the top of the file `src/main.cpp` for number of dots  
## Build instructions
This requires Raylib, idk how it will work on windows but uhhh  
### Linux build
```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make

Run the bin file
Profit???
```
